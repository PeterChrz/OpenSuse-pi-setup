# OpenSuse-pi-setup
OpenSuse Raspberry Pi configuration

##Purpose##
To provide a script to get a new OpenSuse Raspberry Pi installation configured and running as quickly as possible. 

While patching issues with this fix, I am also bringing them up to the OpenSuse Raspberry Pi team to promote fixes or at least understand the issues deeper. 

-Currently testing basic functionality so many functions are commented out.
